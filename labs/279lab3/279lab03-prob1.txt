Type YOUR NAMES after the line: 
===============================
Evan Putnam, Drake Eichlin, Kristin Tran


1. Consider this set of permissions:

   -rw-r-----

   Assume you have a file named lab1.txt in your current working
   directory.

   Write a chmod command that will explicitly give lab1.txt
   these permissions.

   chmod 640 lab1.txt

============



2. Consider this set of permissions:

   drwxr-xr--

   Assume you have a directory named lab-stuff in your current working
   directory.

   Write a chmod command that will explicitly give lab-stuff these
   permissions

   chmod 754 lab-stuff

============



3. Assume you have a file named lab2.txt in your current working
   directory.

   Assume this chmod command is done:

   chmod 664 lab2.txt

   After this command is done, how would lab2.txt's permissions be
   displayed by:

   ls -l lab2.txt

   -rw-rw-r--

============



4. Assume you have a directory named lab-things in your current
   working directory.

   Assume this chmod command is done:

   chmod 711 lab-things

   After this command is done, how would lab-things' permissions be
   displayed by:

   ls -ld lab-things

   drwx--x--x

============



5. Write a shell command setting a local shell variable our_names so that 
   its value is both of your names.

   our_names="Evan Putnam, Drake Eichlin, Kristin Tran"

============



6. Write a shell command, using your shell variable from Problem 5,
   that will echo the value of that shell variable you
   created in Problem 5 to the screen.

   echo $our_names

============



7. Fun fact: command wc, word count, can, as one of its possibilities,
   be given the name of a file as its argument,
   and it prints the number of lines, words, and bytes in that file.

   Write a shell command setting a local variable stats so that its
   value is the result of calling the wc command on this file
   279lab03-prob1.txt

   word_count=`wc 279lab03-prob1.txt`
.
============



8. Write a shell command, using your variable from Problem 7,
   that will echo the value of that shell variable you created
   in Problem 7 to the screen.

   echo $word_count

============



9. Assume this shell command has been run:

   question="How are you?"

   For each statement below, type what it would print to the screen:
============

   echo $question

   How are you?

   echo "$question is my question"

   How are you? is my question

   echo 'Why not ask $question'

   Why not ask $question
   
   echo \$question: $question

   $question: How are you?

10. Assume this shell command has now also been run (after Problem 8's
    shell command):

    question2="What does it mean?"

    For each statement below, type what it would print to the screen:
============

    echo $question2

    What does it mean?

    echo ${question}2
   
    How are you?2

11. Assume this shell command has been run:

    let quantity=13

    For each fragment below, type what the last line in that fragment
    would print to the screen:
============

    let quantity=$quantity+10
    echo $quantity

    23

    let quantity=113
    quantity=$quantity+20
    echo $quantity

    11320

    let quantity=213
    quantity+=30
    echo $quantity

    21330

    let quantity=313
    let quantity+=40
    echo $quantity

    353
