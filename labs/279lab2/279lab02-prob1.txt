Type in your answers WITHIN this file
(do NOT delete the questions!)

Type YOUR NAMES after the line: 
===============================
Evan Putnam, Giselle Urquijo


1. Consider the following sequence of commands;
   assume they are being typed within a newly-created,
   currently-empty directory:

   mkdir cache
   cd cache
   echo treasure > chest.txt
   cd ..

   After the line, type one or more commands such that, after those
   commands have been run, directory cache and any contents it happens
   to have will have been deleted:

   rm cache/chest.txt
   rmdir cache

==========================================




2. Consider the	following sequence of commands;
   assume they are being typed within a	newly-created,
   currently-empty directory:

   mkdir try-it
   cd try-it
   echo hidden stuff > .chest.txt
   echo obvious stuff > box.txt
   cd ..
   echo local stuff > here.txt

   After the line, type a single command
   NOT using echo and including try-it within it
   that will print to the screen as its output:
.		..		.chest.txt	box.txt   

   ls -a try-it


==========================================



3. Assume that your current directory contains only these files:

   alpha.txt
   beta.cpp
   delta.cpp
   epsilon.txt
   gamma.h
   zeta.h

   And then this command is run:
   mkdir put-here

   After the line, type one or more commands such that, after those
   commands have been run, the current directory will contain the SAME
   files as it does right now, but directory put-here will now also
   contain files gamma.h and zeta.h whose contents are the same as
   those in the current directory.

   cp *.h put-here/


==========================================




   
4. Assume that your current directory contains only these files:

   alpha.txt
   beta.cpp
   delta.cpp
   epsilon.txt
   gamma.h
   put-here
   zeta.h

   And then this command is run:
   mkdir save-me

   After the line, type one or more commands such that, after those
   commands are run, the current directory will contain only:

   alpha.txt
   epsilon.txt
   gamma.h
   put-here
   save-me
   zeta.h

   ...and directory save-me will contain these files:

   beta.cpp
   delta.cpp

   ...whose contents are the same as those files that were
   previously in the current directory.

   mv *.cpp save-me/

==========================================





5. Consider the following sequence of commands;
   assume they are being typed within a newly-created,
   currently-empty directory:

   mkdir project1
   cd project1
   mkdir p1-part1
   mkdir p1-part2
   cd p1-part2
   mkdir p1-part2-extras
   cd p1-part2-extras

   After the line, type one or more commands such that, after those
   command(s) are run, the current working directory will be p1-part1.

   cd ../../p1-part1

==========================================





6. Consider the following sequence of commands;
   assume they are being typed within a newly-created,
   currently-empty directory:

   echo first > looky.txt
   echo second > looky.txt
   echo third >> looky.txt
   cat looky.txt

   After the line, type what the last command above will output
   to the screen:
 
   second
   third
